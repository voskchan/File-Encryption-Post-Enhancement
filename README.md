# File-Encryption-Post-Enhancement
Post Enhancement Version of File Encryption application for CS 499

This version of the File encryption application uses a randomized key for the XOR cipher. It also uses a key that is generated to be the length of the data file to help prevent breaking the pattern that can be made using a shorter key. File checks have also been added to ensure there is an input file attached to prevent crashes. 

The application has a .exe file that can be found in the x64/release folder. It requires the input file to located in the same directory as the .exe file. It also requires use of the C++ 17+ language standard for file checking.
